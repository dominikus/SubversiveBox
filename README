SubversiveBox

SubversiveBox brings all the Dropbox-usability-goodness to plain
old SVN repositories. Start SubversiveBox on a working copy to let
it automatically commit changes, new files and folders and deletions
to your server, so you can focus on working instead of submitting.

Usage:  SubversiveBox.exe <folder to watch> <SVN username>

		or
		
        SubversiveBox.exe <folder to watch> <SVN username> <SVN password>

Caveats:
SubversiveBox does not support the renaming of folders at the moment
(something which you shouldn't do in a working copy anyway). To rename
a folder, please stop SubversiveBox and use SVN's 'rename' command.

Also, SubversiveBox is very early alpha-software: Use it with caution
and always make backups of important files.
